                    <p>Unlike most other landscape contractors, The Landscape Company is a Design-Build company. What does this mean to you? It means that your entire project stays in our expert hands, from concept to completion. Your project will be designed by experts, and installed by experts, all of whom are part of the same cohesive team. Instead of bouncing back and forth between designers, softscape installers, and stoneworkers, you will deal with one team for everything, and any questions or concerns will be dealt with immediately.</p>
                    <p>Most landscape contractors subcontract their designs, meaning that once construction begins, the designer is no longer a part of the process. When working with The Landscape Company, our entire team from design staff, to construction staff, is part of the process. Your project is completed by our own ‘in-house’ staff from start to finish.</p>
                    <p>Our crews are comprised of professional career landscape contractors, all of whom have been with us for a number of years. Our construction staff consists of landscape technicians, natural stone masons and horticulturalists. Our staff is constantly enrolled in industry courses and you can be assured that they are knowledgeable and up to date with the latest practices and techniques in the field.</p>
                    <p>Our clients often remark on how knowledgeable, friendly, and approachable our construction crews are. Through the course of a project, you will develop a friendly yet professional relationship with the crew, easing the anxiety usually associated with any construction project.</p>
                    <p>Having highly trained and professional crews ensures your project will be done on time, and on budget.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>A cohesive and well thought out landscape plan is the most important step in achieving your goals for your project. It is the result of collaboration between you and our designer. Your plan allows you to see the finished result “inch for inch” before you invest your hard-earned money into the entire project. A plan allows changes to be made ‘on paper’, before construction begins to save you time and money during the building phase of your project.</p>
                    <p>Our award winning landscape designer will introduce you to your property in a way you have never seen it. With over 20 years of experience, our designer will meet with you to look at your property, review your desires and concerns, and introduce visual aids of possible features and materials to inform and educate you on the possibilities of your project.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the process, the final plan will clearly reflect your wishes and needs, through the vision and expertise of our designer. The result will be a reflection of your aspirations based on the natural characteristics of your property, your lifestyle, and your budget. The final plan will unlock the potential of your property, enhance your lifestyle by revealing an entirely new outdoor living space to compliment your indoor space, and will allow you to realize a return on your investment by raising the value of your property.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Landscape lighting can be an important element in any landscape project. Properly installed landscape lighting will extend the enjoyment time of the landscape, allowing you to use and showcase the space well into the evening hours. As well as adding to the aesthetics of the landscape, the illumination of features such as steps and walkways will make the area safer to navigate. Landscape lighting will also improve the security of your property, illuminating an otherwise dark space and making it less appealing for unwanted visitors.</p>
                    <p>A lighting layout must be planned carefully and properly. In order to achieve the best results, a ‘less is more’ approach is key. Choosing the proper fixtures, and creating a well-balanced lighting theme that highlights the key focal points of a landscape without flooding the entire space with light should be the end result. The Landscape Company Inc. has been designing and installing landscape lighting for our clients for years. After your landscape design is finalized, our designers will create an optional lighting plan that will achieve all of these results, and our licensed landscape electrician will then install this element of your landscape properly, and to code.</p>
